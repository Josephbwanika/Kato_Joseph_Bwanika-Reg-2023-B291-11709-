Kato Joseph Bwanika – Final Project Test
REG:2023-B291-11709
Dataset Description
The dataset (from a ZIP archive) includes:

Train.csv – 23,524 rows, 13 features (incl. target: bankaccount)

Test.csv – 10,086 rows, 12 features for prediction

SampleSubmission.csv – Format for model output (33,610 rows)

VariableDefinitions.csv – Descriptions for 12 demographic and socioeconomic variables (e.g., country, year, locationtype, cellphoneaccess, educationlevel, jobtype, etc.)

Methodology
The notebook uses pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and follows:

Data Ingestion: Automatic extraction and loading of all CSV files.

Descriptive Analysis: Dataset previews, summary statistics, missing-value checks (none found), and class distribution (≈81% "No" bankaccount).

Data Cleaning: Mean imputation for numeric features and mode imputation for categorical features.

Visualization: Histograms and count plots to explore distributions and relationships.

🔍 Key Findings
Significant rural vs. urban differences in cellphone access.

Education levels show strong patterns with employment types.

Notable temporal variation across survey years (2016–2018).

These insights set the stage for feature engineering and model building.
